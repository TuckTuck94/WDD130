    <p>Hey everyone! It's super awesome to be apart of this class and journey with you!</p>
    <p>As I've said before, I'm Mike. I'm currently aiming to achieve an Applied Technology Degree from BYU-Idaho. With current aims to persue a Law Degree after achieving my Bachelors. I'm generally on my computer most of the time and I'm glad this assignment starts with HTML. It's a good refresher for me since I haven't done any coding like this since I graduated High School.</p>
    <p>One of my hobbies includes playing games. At the current time, I am unemployed part time due to battling an illness which I will not disclose at this time. On my spare time I'm usually playing World of Warcraft, Nintendo Switch, or even just watching YouTube. I have a pretty simple schedule.</p>
    <p>In addition to all that, I have been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for 10 years. I served my Mission in California after being off and on about going on one. If you haven't done so, I heavily recommend it. It's changed my life for the better. In addition I have a wonderful calling! I'm currently the Music Coordinator and I'm in charge of Special Musical Numbers and leading the Choir. Music is one of my passions and it's only been amplified with this calling. </p>
