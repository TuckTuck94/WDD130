        Normal paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p>
        What is one thing we all have in common? We all have cell phones which disconnect us from nature. However, there is nature all around us. And we can make it a game for each and every single one of us! Disc Golf allows us to get close to nature around us and enjoy having a game with our friends. Best part about it, it's free!
      </p>
      <h3>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h3>
      <p class="colored">
        All we need to do to get started is get a few discs, a backpack, and a few waters. All you need to do afterwards is to just walk to the nearest park with a course and start throwing! Just beware of the trees. They can cause your score to decrease rapidly if you keep hitting them!
