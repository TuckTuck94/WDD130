            <h2>Northeast Lions Park</h2> 
            <p>Established in 1976, Northeast Lions Park is one of the oldest courses in all of the US. With a good mix of open and wooded areas, this course is best for those wanting to learn the sport. The course has 18 holes, with Hole 3 dedicated to a player known as "Foggy" who loved the course til his death.</p>

            <h2>Colonial Estates</h2> 
            <p>Colonial Estates is the Second Oldest Course in Norman, OK. Established in 1990, it is a mixed course with open and wooded shots. While it's not difficult, many fairways play along or across a creek notorious for eating discs! If you're afraid of losing them, consider skipping holes 2, 11, and 13.</p>

            <h2>Griffin Memorial</h2> 
            <p>The course that offers the most challenge, in my personal opinion would have to be Griffin Memorial! Established in 2005 it has long fairways, open shots, and notoriously difficult wooded areas with trees that are guaranteed to make you bogey! If you can brave its difficulty, then the course is incredibly fun!</p>
