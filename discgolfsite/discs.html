            <h2>Drivers</h2> 
            <p>With a sharp beveled edge and with most mass concentrated on the outer rim. The driver prioritizes aerodynamics and they're designed to fly at maximum speed and distance. They're typically thrown at the beginning of the hole or during long fairway drives. My personal favorites include the Beast and Destroyer discs. Both made by Innova.</p>

            <h2>Mid-Range</h2> 
            <p>Much like Irons (and sometimes Woods) in regular golf. They offer more control at the sacrifice of range. They are identified with their dull edge and moderate rim. My personal favorite includes the Discraft Buzzz which is pictured. In addition to the Innova Roc3. Which I also throw very frequently.</p>

            <img class="putter-img" src="images/Disc Page/discgolfputter.png" alt="disc golf putter">
            <h2>Putters</h2> 
            <p>The Putter is the slowest of the three, designed to fly straight and are often used to finish out a drive. The Putter is a necessity for every game. Especially when you find yourself in a tight spot. Personal favorites include the G-Star Aviar3 by Innova and the RhynoX. Both good putters. Personal recommendation is to have three for different scenarios you may wind up in.</p>
